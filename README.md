# printing_kiosk_system

This project is all about developing a self-service printing kiosk that can help students
in their daily routine in the university whenever the other printing services inside or near
the university is closed or cost of printing is too much for the students. This self-service
printing kiosk has a system that can print in different bond paper sizes such as letter size,
legal size, or A4, in multiple formats such as .pdf, .doc, .docx, .ppt, .pptx, .jpg, .png, .xlxs,
.odt, .ods, and .odp. This self-service kiosk has a bring-your-own-bond paper policy in
which lets the users print their files in their desired bond paper size, and desired number of
pages.
